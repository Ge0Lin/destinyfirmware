# destinyfirmware
Firmware initially for the Xiaomi MiWiFi Mini with plans to eventually extend to other devices
Built in PHP with the following goals:
* Simple, the firmware should target the 95%, not the power-users
* Minimal, remove anything that doesn't *really* need to be asked, don't give the user an overabundance of choices
* Intuitive to use, no manuals and no online help, with minimal "tips" in the interface where required
* Clean, based very loosely on Material Design
* Mobile + Desktop, it shouldn't matter if you plug the device in and use a cellphone, tablet or laptop to set it up
* Naming devices, the central 'theme' for navigation around the UI
